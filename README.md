There are several sections in the social network, the first one is 'Profile'. Here you will see information about users,
and you can also change yours. There is also a feed of posts that the user can create.

More than 20,000 users have already registered on the social network. You can see their entire list in the "Users"
section. From there, you can go to their "Profile" and view their information.
